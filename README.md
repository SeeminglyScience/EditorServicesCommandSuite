You can call any of the editor commands as functions like you would from any module. Or you can import them as registered editor commands in Editor Services.

### Import all Editor Commands

```powershell
Import-Module EditorServicesCommandSuite
Import-EditorCommand -Module EditorServicesCommandSuite
```

### Import specific Editor Commands

```powershell
Import-Module EditorServicesCommandSuite
Get-Command ConvertTo-MarkdownHelp, ConvertTo-SplatExpression | Import-EditorCommand
```

## Using Editor Commands

Check out the [Using Editor Commands](http://powershell.github.io/PowerShellEditorServices/guide/extensions.html#using-editor-commands) guide in the PowerShell Editor Services documentation.  I also highly recommend setting up a hotkey for the editor command menu.  Here is mine as an example.

```json
{ "key": "ctrl+shift+c",   "command": "PowerShell.ShowAdditionalCommands",
                              "when": "editorLangId == 'powershell'" },
```

## Settings

This module is built to be compatible with the project structure from my Plaster template [SSPowerShellBoilerplate](https://github.com/SeeminglyScience/SSPowerShellBoilerplate).  If you prefer a different structure you can configure the paths with a workspace settings file.  You can create a default settings file in the current workspace with the [New-ESCSSettingsFile](./docs/en-US/New-ESCSSettingsFile.md) function.
